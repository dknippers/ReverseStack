# SmartStack

> CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, NOT YET FUNCTIONAL.

A Stacklands mod that improves stacking cards in various scenarios:

-   It is now possible to drop a Resource card (e.g. Apple Tree, Rock) on top of a Villager.

    -   This is possible in all cases where the game currently allows dropping a Villager on top of that Resource (or stack of Resources).
    -   The Resource will be placed underneath the Villager, i.e. the final stack will be equivalent to when the Villager would have been placed on top of the Resource.

-   It is now possible to add a Resource card X to a stack that consists entirely of other X cards with a Villager on top.

    -   For example, if you have a stack of Apple Trees that is being harvested by a Villager you can now add another Apple Tree to that stack by simply dropping it on the existing stack. The base game does not support this scenario and only allows the reverse: grabbing the stack that is being worked on and dropping it on the new Apple Tree. This mod simply makes both directions work.

-   When a card is created and cannot find a nearby space or stack to add itself to that card will now be moved to the nearest free space on the board regardless how far away it is. Currently such cards will start floating around, pushing all nearby cards away which creates a mess on the board.
